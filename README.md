A simple game for video conference calls

## number of players: 3+ (the more the merrier)

## requirements: all players are on one video call with cameras, visible to each other
(phones/tablets preferred because they are mobile)

# Instructions

The person [closest to the equator](https://i.imgur.com/sEyXniB.jpg) is the **chooser** and is the one to start the game.

the **chooser** picks a **prompt** from the list, or (preferably) **makes up their own request** 

then all other players play that prompt (showing an item in their space, etc.) (the chooser does not play the prompt)

the chooser then picks another player to be the new chooser, and play repeats with the **new chooser**
